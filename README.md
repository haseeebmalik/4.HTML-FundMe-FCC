Later on we will use Next.js and react for frontend.

we will run it with hardhat local node.

first we will run local node in our hardhat repository ie "3.Hardhat-Fund-Me-FCC".
Then we will add our local hardhat network in matamask.
Then we import one of our account given by hardhat in matamask.

Now connect our app to metamask and read and write data on blockchain.
